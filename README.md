# FlickerFetcherTest

### Notes on things to be done or improved:

- Implement unit tests. Right now they were evicted as the subject was to fix and improve the current code in the minimum time possible. But unit and UI tests would still be an essential add to the test.
- Some classes could and should be more generic through conforming to protocols to respect the non dependency between objects at different levels.
- Architecture design could and should be remade as right now, it's not completely refined and has some not so optimized implementations.
