# FlickerFetcherTest

### Notes on things to be done or improved:

- Change UIStackView to UITableView for comments section and implement a caching system just like the one for photos fetching.
- Created a back arrow for ccomment sections so it could still be used with < iOS13 devices. Remove the arrow for iOS13+ and adapt the constraints accordingly.
- Create a coordinator on top to manage push to navigation controller instead of push/present from the current collection view
